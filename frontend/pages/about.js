        <p>
          Over the last 2 decades I've lived in 3 major cities, most of which
          has revolved around going to live events, namely concerts. A major way
          that I found out about events for smaller shows was by just walking
          around and seeing posters bands and street teams would put up for
          events. When I started learning to make apps I thought it would be
          cool to archive this art instead of being destroyed.

          So now we're here. This is Show Up! I invite you to add in your own
          posters for your band, venue, or were commissioned to do by creating
          an account and filling in forms. Otherwise, treat this site as you
          would a street pole. Acknowledge that there is no rhyme or reason to
          the view and that you can't click or share anything - just a place to
          recognize the beauty and effort all these talented humans put into
          making art that the rain strips away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, with time and contributions, this platform will become
          more robost. So we can have things like filtering by year or city or
          decade and see how art for marketing shows has changed over time or
          location.
